# BizzBuzz is an online e-commerce site which I built in my 3rd year of university as the Database course project . This project was built using node.js, express.js, react and mysql. One can buy products as a buyer and also he can be a seller to sell products. All of the purchases, transaction info gets stored in the main database to keep a record. An admin always keeps an eye on the overall website.
